                <p>I'm Annette Arrigucci, and I'm a former digital-focused journalist making a career change to full-stack ASP.NET/C# web developer. While I've been working with technology and websites a lot over the past eight years, late last year I decided that I wanted to take a deep dive into coding. I'm currently attending a Coder Foundry “code boot camp” in to learn more about web development with ASP.NET and C#.</p>
                <p>News and technology have been the two pillars of my career since 2008. I started my career managing content for KVIA-TV's website in 2008. It was great fun to get an inside look at TV news, and I got hooked on learning about the issues that affected my border community. From there I went to a homepage editor role at the El Paso Times, eventually working my way up to digital media manager in 2012. During my time as manager we boosted our social media accounts (from 50,000 to 80,000 fans on Facebook) and won Texas APME awards for special projects on public corruption and water conservation. The newsroom also took home the Texas APME Online Newspaper of the Year award for our work in 2014.</p>
                <p>In 2015 I moved to Augusta, Georgia, with my husband after we got married in February. I took a job at The Augusta Chronicle doing copy editing and also helping update the website and social media accounts. I'm proud to say while I was there I set up online high school score submissions, saving my coworkers at least a few hours a week of being on the phone with coaches.</p>
                <p>And now I'm looking to make a career change, amid changes in the news industry as well as a new phase in my life. I believe journalism and technology are both tools that can be used to make the world a better place. As a programmer I hope to make people's lives better through useful, well-designed technology tools. I know my skills in content management, leadership, organization and communication developed over eight years in the news industry will be an asset during the next phase of my career. I love to learn, and I'm a data and analytics nerd in that I try to use data and the latest research to help inform my decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working I'm reading for fun, hanging out with my husband, on the phone with my family or planning my next travel adventure.
